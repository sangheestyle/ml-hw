Feature Engineering
=

Due: 13. February

The aim of this assignment is to do text classification on trivia questions,
sorting them into their appropriate category.  We'll be using the logistic regression
classifier provided by *sklearn*.

Unlike previous assignments, the code provided with this assignment has all of
the functionality required.  Your job is to make the functionality better by
improving the features the code uses for text classification.

*NOTE*: Because the goal of this assignment is feature engineering, not
classification algorithms, you _may not_ change the underlying algorithm.

About the Data
--------------

You can get the data from the Kaggle site (it's also included in the Git repo).

Quiz bowl is an academic competition between schools in English-speaking
countries; hundreds of teams compete in dozens of tournaments each year. Quiz
bowl is different from Jeopardy, a recent application area. While Jeopardy also
uses signaling devices, these are only usable after a question is completed
(interrupting Jeopardy's questions would make for bad television). Thus,
Jeopardy is rapacious classification followed by a race---among those who know
the answer---to punch a button first.

Here's an example of a quiz bowl question:

> Expanding on a 1908 paper by Smoluchowski, he derived a formula for the intensity of scattered light in media fluctuating densities that reduces to Rayleigh's law for ideal gases in The Theory of the Opalescence of Homogenous Fluids and Liquid Mixtures near the Critical State. That research supported his theories of matter first developed when he calculated the diffusion constant in terms of fundamental parameters of the particles of a gas undergoing Brownian Motion. In that same year, 1905, he also published On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light. That explication of the photoelectric effect won him 1921 Nobel in Physics. For ten points, name this German physicist best known for his theory of Relativity.
>
> *answer*: Albert _Einstein_

Two teams listen to the same question. Teams interrupt the question at any point
by "buzzing in"; if the answer is correct, the team gets points and the next
question is read. Otherwise, the team loses points and the other team can
answer.

Classifying Category
---------------------

There are many kinds of questions asked in these tournaments: science (as
above), literature, history, etc.  The goal of this project is to create an
automated system that predicts the category of a question as accurately as
possible.

These data will be the subject of the final project (you'll help to answer the
questions), so this will be a useful warmup to help you get to know these data a
little bit better.

Submission
-----------

In addition to turning in your code on Moodle, you'll also need to submit your
predictions on Kaggle, an online tournament site for machine learning
competitions.  You must sign up with your Colorado e-mail (it's a restricted entry competition).

In addition: 
* please turn in a file called _explanation.pdf_ explaining your process of creating additional features.  Make sure you state your username there.
* upload your feature extraction code that produced your predictions

Your username should be of the form _CU_IDENTIKEY_
that we can easily map it to your grade.

How this Assignment is Graded (35+ points)
------------------------------

You'll get full credit on this assignment (35 points) if you can significantly
improve on the baseline system (as reported by the Kaggle system).  If you can
do much better than your peers, you can earn extra credit (up to 15 points).

Questions / Hints
----------------

* Don't use all the data until you're ready.  Use the \texttt{--subsample} option to use a subset of the data to see how you're doing on smaller datasets.
* Examine the features that are being used.
* Do error analyses.
